# Rice-Image-Classification-with-Deep-Learning

Overview

This repository contains datasets and models used for the classification of rice varieties using deep learning methods. The project focuses on distinguishing between five different rice varieties—Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag—commonly grown in Turkey. The datasets include 75,000 grain images (15,000 from each variety).

Our task is to make a classification model that could correctly predict the 5 kinds of rice.
